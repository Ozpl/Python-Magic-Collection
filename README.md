# Python Magic Collection

This was my first attempt at creating a program with graphic interface. Goal was to have a program, in which I could manage my MTG card collection, as well as build deck from cards available to me. It was suppose to support set progression tracking, wishlisting cards and importing/exporting collections from most popular internet websites.
